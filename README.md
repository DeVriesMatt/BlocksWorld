# BlocksWorld
The “Blocksworld Tile Puzzle”, is an example of a toy problem used to illustrate different tree-search and graph-search problem solving methods. This is useful when comparing the performance of different algorithms as the researcher is able to easily control the complexity. Essentially, it requires an agent to build a tower of blocks through a series of actions. We are tasked with implementing a number of uninformed tree-search algorithms; depth-first, breadth-first, iterative deepening, as well as informed (heuristic) search algorithms such as A∗ search. The problem can be described formally by five components: the initial state, a description of the possible actions, what each action does (also defined by the successors reachable by a given state by a single action), a goal test, and finally the path cost.
